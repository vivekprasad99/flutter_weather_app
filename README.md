# flutter_weather_app

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project used Clean Architecture as Architecture pattern.and i have used Bloc as a state management.
I have used 3rd Party Api called OpenWeather Api for the Api integration.
I have write down the unit testing for all the features and used Mockito for mocking the dependencies.
I have used Dio for Http request and getit for dependency injection.
for storing Api Keys used flutter_dotenv package and put it in gitignore file.
By default i have pass one city("mumbai") so that in starting the screen should not be seen as empty.

Thank you.
